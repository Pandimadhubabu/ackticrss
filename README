## JQuery Terminal RSS News

## About

I wrote a JQuery Terminal RSS Feed Reader with a PHP backend in 2015, scrapping it in a couple months.  This is the 2019 vanilla JQuery version I call
'HIWI'an acroynm for 'How I Want It'.

## HOWTO

Simply add RSS XML feeds to the menu array (except reddit) and point and click commands or type command and return for menu.  It works locally browsing
to the index.html file or host it on a web server.
